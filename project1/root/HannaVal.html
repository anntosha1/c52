        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi! I'm Hanna Val and I'm an immigrant from Ukraine who is looking for new opportunities in life and want to make work that will make me and people for whom I'll work happy. I believe that technologies make our life easier and better (educational web-sites, medical programming, studying programming).<br>
            I want to be a software engineer and plan to be good at the next software developing technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C#, Python, React, SASS/LESS, Git'/Github, npm.<br>
            I see myself in Front End Development because I am a "visual" person. I like to see the result of my work with my own eyes. I feel interest and desire to solve the problem. I'm not afraid to learn some new technologies, because it impresses me how they work and makes development easier and faster (Flex, Grid, BEM, Libraries, frameworks). My goal is to become professional in Front End Development and making quality and beautiful sites and applications.
        </p>

        <h2>Video that inspires me:</h2>
        <iframe width="560"

        <p>
            Such videos always inspire me because they are about the fact that <b style="color: #ee4035"><i>you can actually do everything</i></b>, even if you don’t feel “muscle” strength.  The power is truly in your <span style="color: #0392cf">motivation</span> and <span style="color: #0392cf">faith</span> in your destiny. <i style="color: #7bc043">If you follow your destiny, nothing will be an obstacle</i>, no matter how reinforced concrete it may seem, no matter how “unclimatic” the circumstances around are.

        <h2>Things I have learned at icstars so far:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                I see that my picture of a world has become wider. Because of stories of other graduated students I see that you can stand up and break up the circle of low paying jobs that have immigrants in America.
            </li>
            <li>
                Now I understand that being a programmer means not only the actual programming, but also some business processes and also communication.
            </li>
            <li>
                I learned how to introduce somebody at High Tea.
            </li>
